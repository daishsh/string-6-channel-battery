/**
  EUSART1 Generated Driver File

  @Company
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name
    eusart1.c

  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the EUSART1 driver using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for EUSART1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - 4.15.1
        Device            :  PIC16F15323
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.40
